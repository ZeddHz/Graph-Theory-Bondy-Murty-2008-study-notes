== Chapter 16: Matchings

=== 16.1 Maximum matchings

A matching is a set of non-adjacent edges. We like to make matchings as big as possible; small matchings are easy, big matchings are hard.
Finding a maximum matching is like pairing up adjacent vertices, leaving as few vertices as possible unmatched.

**Climbing analogy:** a group of climbers go climbing in the mountains, but they don't all know each other. They have to pair up to climb, but each can only pair up with someone they know - because, you know, it could be dangerous. Then the goal is to find the right pairing, so that as many people as possible can climb at the same time.

M-augmenting path are a way of transitioning from a matching to a larger matching. 
 **Berge's theorem** tells you that following such transitions does not get you stuck in local maxima: you always end up in a maximum matching.
 
I find this illuminating, because at first sight matchings are not a very "path-esque" notion.

=== 16.2 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs

Hall's Theorem gives you a necessary, and more importantly sufficient condition for the existence of a matching covering one side X of a bipartite graph G[X,Y]:
 namely, that each subset of X has no less neighbours than vertices.

Konig-Ore's formula (ex 16.2.7) generalizes this result to not just know if there's a matching covering all of X, but to actually find the matching number.

In the proofs of both theorems, you consider the set of vertices reachable from unmatched vertices by M-alternating paths.


=== 16.3 Matchings in arbitrary graphs

Barriers seem to play an opposite role to M-augmenting paths: they're evidence that a matching is maximum. Like Hall's theorem, it's a matter of computing the cardinalites of subsets of vertices, but this time it's odd components, not neighbours.

Not obviously at all, all graphs have a barrier: that's the Tutte-Berge Theorem.

It's not very apparent from (16.3) that the definition of a barrier is independent from the matching considered; to make it clearer, you can define a barrier as a set `B` of vertices such that `o(G-B) - |B| = n - 2Î±'`.

It's insightful to view the Tutte-Berge theorem as a min/max theorem: the minimum number of unmatched vertices for all matchings is equal to the maximum of `o(G-S) - S` for all proper subsets `S` of `G`.
